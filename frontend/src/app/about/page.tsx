        <h1>About the Project</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>Plantiva</strong> is an intelligent plant disease detection and remedy platform that empowers farmers, agriculturists, and hobbyists to diagnose crop health issues early using the power of AI and computer vision.
        </p>
        <p>
          This web-based solution allows users to upload images of affected plant leaves, and in return, receive accurate predictions about the disease, confidence score, and treatment suggestions. It leverages a hybrid approach combining a custom-trained machine learning model with the <strong>Plant.id API</strong> for higher accuracy and reliability.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal is to minimize crop loss and maximize agricultural productivity by making disease detection fast, accessible, and easy to use â€” especially for those in remote or resource-constrained areas.
        </p>
        <h2>Key Features</h2>
